		<td class="info"><b>What's New in PopTray 3.0</b><br>
			New features and enhancements added since version 2.1.<br><br>
			Some of the most significant changes are:
			<ul>
				<li><b>XP Look</b><br>
					All toolbars and buttons now look more like Windows XP
					applications.  All icons are true color (including the
					tray icon).  The PopTray controls now also support
					XP themes.</li>
				<li><b>Plug-ins</b><br>
					PopTray 3.x now supports plug-ins.  These are DLLs copied
					into your plugins directory for more functionality in
					PopTray.  PopTray 3.0 supports two types of plugins:
					Protocol and Notify.  Example plugins (like IMAP4, POP3SSL,
					Hotmail) are available for download from the
					<a href="http://www.poptray.org" target="_blank">PopTray</a>
					website.</li>
				<li><b>Attachments</b><br>
					The preview screen now has proper support for attachments.
					It will list them with icons, and you can save them to disk.</li>
				<li><b>White List / Black List</b><br>
					Quickly list your friends and enemy e-mail address.  Messages
					from anyone in the black list will be deleted (or marked as spam)
					without you having to create a rule.  Mail from people in the white
					list will be protected against auto-deletion.</li>
				<li><b>Customizable Toolbars</b><br>
					There are three fully customizable toolbars (mail,accounts,rules).
					Use drag-and-drop to add and remove buttons from the toolbar.</li>
				<li><b>Options new look</b><br>
					The options screen has been redesigned with a tree-view
					to break the options into logical divisions.</li>
				<li><b>New Options</b><br>
					The following new options have been added:
					<ul>
						<li><b><i><font color="#CC6633">Remember viewed Messages</font></i></b>
							- Poptray will remember when you've viewed a message and
							save the IDs to disk so it will be saved even after quiting
							the program.</li>
						<li><b><i><font color="#CC6633">Quick Checking</font></i></b>
							- Quick Checking has been improved a lot.  With this option
							only new message headers will be downloaded.</li>
						<li><b><font color="#CC6633"><i>Advanced Show Info</i></font></b>
							- This will pop-up a info window showing all new messages since
							your last check.  Also show a summary of all your accounts, and
							includes buttons to quickly run your e-mail client or ignore the
							new mail.</li>
						<li><b><font color="#CC6633"><i>Hide Viewed Messages</i></font></b>
							- This is handy for people the leave their messages on the server
							and don't want the PopTray window cluttered with old messages.</li>
						<li><i><b><font color="#CC6633">Don't Check between</font></b></i>
							- Specify the hours that you want to automatically disable
							checking in PopTray.</li>
						<li><i><b><font color="#CC6633">Retrieve Body while Checking</font></b></i>
							- Usefull when you have fast connection.  The complete body can
							be checked by the rules, and also external Bayesian filters can
							analize your message body.</li>
					</ul></li>
				<li><b>Command-line Options</b><br>
					PopTray now supports calling <a href="options.htm#actions"><i>actions</i></a>
					from the command-line for powerful scheduling options.</li>
			</ul>
