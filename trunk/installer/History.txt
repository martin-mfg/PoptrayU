PopTrayU Version History
------------------------

=============
Version 5.1.4
April 2015
=============
New Features
------------
 * "Mark" Toolbar menu on Preview Window to mark as read/unread or flagged/unflagged
 * Right click action to reset preview window toolbar (does a backup but restore can only be done manually)
 * Large icons set added for main window toolbar (must "customize" toolbar to enable this)

Bug Fixes
---------
 * POP: deleting messsage(s) with "limit inbox size" set to a small number causes continous re-checking instead of deleting.
 * IMAP: recent beta(s): preview was not working until second mail check for a given account. (still todo: fix this issue when "top lines" mode enabled)
 * Logging turned off. 5.1.3 only had some logging turned on that may generate log files in either the folder where the application is installed (causing crash reporter on some versions of windows) and/or in the PopTrayU ini/settings folder. log files may need manual deleting at this time (debug.log and imap*.log)
 * Change to notification sound conditions (ignorecount) for messages deleted by rules.

=============
Version 5.1.3
April 2015
=============
New Features
------------
 * IMAP uses read/unread status from the server instead of tracking locally
 * IMAP shows message as "important" if it is starred/flagged on the server

Bug Fixes
---------
 * Recent beta changes to quick check algorithm caused unnecessary full check when quick checking. 
 * Leaving IMAP account connected between checks (introduced in 5.1.2) is buggy when multiple IMAP accounts. Rolled back for now. 


=============
Version 5.1.2
March 2015
=============
New Features
------------
X-Mailer header is now hidden from the preview window unless X-mailer display is enabled in preview options.

IMAP Mark read/unread actions for the the preview window (still experimental).

Bug Fixes
---------
IMPORTANT! Account editing: switching tabs in 5.1.1 (and possibly 5.1.0?) will cause the wrong tab to display in the UI, so saving accounts will overwrite one or more accounts with a different account.

In older version(s) the progress bar for the preview window did not have the correct z-order and could not be seen depending on which tab was selected.

IMAP Quick Check with "recent messages only" mode enabled was downloading UIDs for all messages in the inbox instead of only the N most recent messages. Eliminating this improved check speed considerably for IMAP.

Some options tabs with quickhelp tooltips were not responding to the quick help cursor and now are selectable. (Known bug: Quick help still does not work when themes are enabled)

Codebase Improvements
---------------------
Protocol plugins support removed, to make way for IMAP improvements like inbox filtering (eg: unread only) that the plugin architecture was not designed to support.

More refactoring, especially in the account check and preview areas, to facilitate the future possibility of possible future features like background account checking, changing how much of the message downloads on preview, etc.

=============
Version 5.1.1
February 2015
=============
Bug Fixes
---------
 * "Run/test email client" for last account would fail on 5.1.0
 * Accounts Authentication Mode dropdown was not translatable.
 * French (Canada) translation updated.
 * About tab sub-tabs were not sizing correctly in 5.1.0

=============
Version 5.1.0
February 2015
=============
New Features
------------
Limit Inbox Size - Have thousands of messages in your inbox and message checks are taking too long? Now you can limit PopTrayU to only download the most recent (by server order) N messages (see Main Window options: Limit Inbox Size)

/TRANSLATE command line parameter. For use by translators. Enables a debug window that will list phrases that may be missing translations.

Large Fonts support! For those who are tired of squinting or use Window's Large Fonts setting, support has been added throughout the application to resize labels, edits, and other components vertically to accomodate larger font sizes. Support has also been added in several places (where it did not already exist) for correct horizontal resizing. In most cases the resizing code is custom written for each [Please post on the discussion board if you find any part of the application that does not adequately scale for larger fonts..ColorBoxes not sizing is a known issue] 

Accounts Tab Redesigned. The accounts tab was getting a bit cluttered with all the additional options that have been added since PopTray 3.2 to accomodate SSL capabilities, as well as other newer features like do not check hours. The configuration options for accounts have been organized into categories to make it easier to create and manage accounts. All the information from your ISP about your account is in one category, for example. PopTrayU behaviors for that account are together. And the fields and boxes all automatically resize and reposition themselves to match the current font and language settings.

Options Tab redesiged. The accounts tabs looked so awesome that I changed the options tab headings to match (using category panels that minimize/unminimize) to the options panes as well. The list of categories has had a few changes. The Advanced Misc. has been eliminated and its options are now merged into several other categories. Defaults was changed to the first category in the options panel as setting the language is often one of the first things new users will want to change. Two new categories have been added: Rules, and Preview Window. The Rules category gathers several existing options that all relate to rule creation into one place. Some options (on all tabs) have had their descriptions changed, or have been changed from checkboxes to dropdowns or vice versa, to make it more clear what the option is choosing between.

Rule edit page modified to have the collapsible categories and auto-sizing as well.

ColorBoxes for selecting colors are now translatable.

"Select All" Toolbar Action added. This is not shown on the toolbar by default.You can add this action to the toolbar by right clicking on it and selecting customize. If you use a tablet or just dislike the keyboard this is a convenient way to select all or no messages.

Bug Fixes
---------
 * Right click-dragging to reorder Rules is back.
 * Rule account dropdown was not enabling the save button after changing rule account.


Codebase Improvements
---------------------
Most of these changes will have no user-facing impact. But many of them will make the code easier to work with, pave the way for new features that previously weren't feasible, improve performance, or decrease the likelihood of bugs in certain parts of the code.

 * Collections have been replaced with Generics 
 * Accounts Tab, Options Tab, Rules Tab, and About Tab's contents each moved to it's own Form/unit, making them much more managable and cohesive units. This required some changes to the translation engine as well
 * Eliminate use of integer msgNum variables througout code as much as possible, pass object references instead.
 * Clean up & refactor Rules.ini reading/writing code. Read whole ini file before updating UI.
 * Translation engine has had some modifications. It's now a bit more flexible about what it can translate automatically (ComboBoxes, ListViews, TreeViews, Popup Menus/Toolbars), so a bunch of code that used to translate specific items on the UI has been eliminated. Other modifications as well.

5.0 beta 14
	(-) Fix connection error connecting to Hotmail (and other servers) that don't support SASL
	    when Authentication mode set to Auto. 
	(-) Fixed: Test account was still incorrectly reported "UIDL not supported" in beta 12

	(-) Emails of type multipart/mixed were occasionally incorrectly showing up as plain 
	    text instead of HTML.
	(-) Translation/tooltip issues fixed on Main Interface options tab.
	(*) blank.ptlang has been eliminated as it is redundant to language.ptlang
	(*) French (Canada) translation updated

5.0 beta 12
	(-) "Max line length exceeded" in non-conforming email is no longer treated as an error
	    and line breaks are silently added if needed, allowing the message to be decoded
	    and previewable despite invalid headers with no line breaks.
	(-) Test Account (POP): More robust fast UIDL test. Fixes erroneous report that UIDL is not 
	    supported if mailserver does not implement the CAPA command but does implement UIDL.
	(-) Fixed: Rules Tab remained in English regardless of language selection in 5.0.10-11
	(+) French (Canada) translation updated

5.0 beta 11
	(-) Fixed minor memory leak populating languages dialog
	(-) Fixed error message for previewing a deleted email (previously gave a TProgressBar
	    out of range error)
	(-) Fix EIndexOutOfRange exception when using mail list/checking for messages.

5.0 beta 10
	(+) Account color for Rules now includes "Custom" and shows more readable color names, to
	    be consistent with other color pickers throughout the application.
	(+) "Find" option for preview window. Find appears in the message's right-click menu on the 
	    plain-text and RAW tabs, and has a keyboard shortcut Ctrl-F that works on any tab (so 
	    can be used on the HTML preview tab if you use the keyboard shortcut to bring it up)

            message indexing to make it faster). 
	(*) "Test account" rewritten to complete in reasonable amount of time regardless of inbox size. 
	    Now PopTrayU requests message count (STAT) instead of downloading messages and 
	    queries capabilities of the server instead of downloading UIDLs for each message.
	(*) IMAP - deleting multiple messages at once is no longer painfully slow. Now sends the 
	    server the entire list of messages to delete as one list of UIDs instead of individually
	    doing a UID "safe delete" check and then indvidually deleting by relative message number
	    being individually deleted by message number after doing UID check)
	(*) Several non-user facing changes to rules code ("refactoring") 
	(-) Rules was not playing correct notification sound in certain (less common) circumstances

	    or invalid.
	(-) Fixed crash when checking messages after previewing an externally deleted message 
	    with "ignore retrieve errors" set in options.

	    reporting tool.

5.0 beta 7
	(+) Preview Window/HTML preview: now blocks unsafe content (javascript, java, activex, 
	    frames, IE element behaviors, background sounds) by default.
	(+) Preview Window/HTML preview: If show images is disabled, preview should no longer
	    fetch any external content (such as external stylesheets, background images, 
	    videos, etc).
	(+) Preview Window: Print toolbar button now prints in HTML (rather than plain-text) 
	    format when viewing message as HTML and shows a print-preview dialog when print 
	    is pressed rather than sending to default printer.
	(+) Preview Window: Plain text and raw view print now shows the print dialog rather 
	    than sending to the default printer since no option was previously available to 
	    print to a non-default printer.

	(*) Entire project ported from Delphi 7 (written for windows XP) to Delphi XE4 (written 
	    for Windows 7/8).
	(+) Porting means... Support for images with alpha-transparency, so buttons and toolbar 
	    images look nicer. Many images throughout the app have been updated or replaced 
	    to take advantage of this.
	    (Note: Skin.bmp support is broken in this release, as the button skinning code has not 
	    beeen re-written to support alpha-transparency yet). 
	(+) Porting means... The entire look and color scheme of PopTrayU is now skinnable 
            using Delphi VCL Styles 
	(-) Porting means... Labels no longer randomly disappear when you press Alt or 
            change windows 
	(-) Porting means... Issues with certain unicode email headers not decoding 
	    correctly magically disappear

	    requested feature)
	(+) HTML-only emails converted to plain-text are now labeled to indicate they've 
            been converted by PopTrayU.
	(+) HTML-only to Plain-text conversion now removes excess consecutive blank lines.
	(+) Spam toolbar button changed. Default action for this toolbar button is now 
            configurable in Options should you prefer "delete spam" as the spam button.
	(+) Compiled with MadExcept bug reporting tool, so if PopTrayU crashes, user can
	    upload a bug-report (with stack trace, and optionally screenshot) directly to
	    PopTrayU's bug-tracker. 
	(*) Disabled toolbar buttons on the main toolbar changed from image shadow to 
	    grayscale to look nicer
	(*) Ini/Settings code refactored to make development easier 
	(*) Improved debugging capabilities to locate missing/broken translation strings.
	(*) Language Files significantly updated for: Czech, Danish, Dutch, French, German, 
            Hebrew, Italian, Polish, Serbian, Spanish, and Swedish.
	(*) Language files are all UTF-8 instead of misc code-pages, so you can use any language
	    for the UI regardless of your locale.
	(*) Tab added to About page to list image credits seperate from component credits.
	(*) Help file Updated
	(-) Fixes for component positioning for right-to-left languages (Hebrew, Arabic) 
	    partially implemented.
	(-) Preview.customize (for customized toolbars on the preview window) was incorrectly saving 
	    (or at least trying to) in the PopTrayU folder (save may fail under windows 7 depending 
	    on security settings). This has been fixed so it now correctly saves to the ini/settings 
	    folder. Upgrading users who do not wish to redo their toolbar customizations should 
	    manually move this file.
	(-) Bug fixed: Clicking create (new) account when currently on an SSL enabled account did 
	    not correctly reset the port number, leaving invalid default settings.

            preview.
	(+) SASL authentication option for POP3 
	(+) IMAP plugin bundled with PopTrayU installer
	(+) APOP for POP3 built in (no plugin needed)
        (+) SSL, APOP, and STARTTLS options built in (except APOP these
	    require OpenSSL to be installed)
	(*) Indy Networking components upgraded from Version 9 to 10. Some
	    old protocol plugins may no longer be compatible because of this.
	    However, this allows any stock version of OpenSSL to be used,
	    and IMAP support is supposed to be much more reliable in Indy 10.
	(*) Plugin interface has new optional methods for configuring SSL 
            and authentication methods
	(+) Option to change between dark and light toolbar color/image themes
	(-) Fixed word spacing don't check this account on Accounts page

        (-) Handle some partially encoded subjects/headers better.


4.0.9
	(+) Now you can set do not (automatically) check hours on a per
	    account basis. 
	(-) Panel needed to set Timer Interval per account was not showing 
            up immediately after setting timer interval per account
	(-) Fixed Interval settings page to resize labels correctly for 
            non-english languages.
        (-) Fixed a couple spelling mistakes and inconsistent capitalization
        (*) Updated German and Blank translation files for latest version
            of PopTrayU.

4.0.8
        (*) Upgraded Indy Components from 9.0.18 to 9.0.53. This should 
            improve stability and reduce network-related bugs in general.
        (-) Fix fatal Access Violation downloading certain specific email 
            headers. 

4.0 (beta 7)
        (-) Fixed bug where preview window would freeze loading html-only 
            emails with invalid HTML including extraneous '>'s.
        (-) Fixed minor memory leaks setting fonts, refreshing plugins, 
            and a couple other places.
        (+) Now possible to reset all font/color customizations, not just 
            the main listbox.
        (-) Preview window, in plain text view, now supports a wider range
            of international characters.
        (-) Preview window, pressing "Reply" when the HTML tab is selected
            now copies the plain-text version of the email into the reply
            window instead of a blank message. 
        (-) Links beginning with http:// are opened in the default browser
            from HTML preview window.

4.0 (beta 6)
        (+) Custom is now an option in the list of choices for account colors.
            No more being limited to VGA colors for tray icon colors.
        (*) Options screens have been re-organized to be easier to navigate.
            No options have been removed, but a few have been renamed or moved
            to a different screen. Locations in PopTray.ini remain unchanged
            for these settings for backward compatibility.
        (-) Some options strings renamed from PopTray to PopTrayU for 
            correctness. (still todo: update translations to match)
        (*) Some of the images in the program have been updated to give the
            program a more modern feel.
        (+) New ability: Disable images on HTML Preview. When images
            are disabled, certain other tags are filtered as well (script,
            object). (Still todo: CSS is not filtered, so images can still
            get through if they are in stylesheet).
        (+) Keyboard shortcuts on Preview window. Save: Ctrl-S. Print: Ctrl-P.
            Reply: Ctrl-R. Delete: Del. Open: Ctrl-O. Toggle Images: Ctrl-I.
        (+) HTML stripped from Plain-text view on HTML-only emails (eg: pinterest)
            (Still todo: Does not yet remove style source code correctly).
        (+) When previewing emails marked as spam, automatically switches to the
            plaintext preview tab, to prevent accidentally downloading spam 
            tracker images.
        (+) Default font for Windows Vista/7 changed to Segoe UI 9pt. Default font
            for XP left as MS Sans Serif 8pt. This makes the app match the usual
            OS UI.
        (+) Visual appearance options added: Change default font for most PopTrayU 
            UI items (global font), and vertical tabs (seperate font).
        (+) Visual appearance Message List color selectors simplified. Custom added
            to dropdowns instead of a seperate button, and now shows user-friendly
            color names.
        (-) Advanced Info Preview Popup now shows international characters instead of 
            question marks like the main window.
        (-) Preview Window now displays the subject in international characters for
            the title bar and subject line (before only UTF-8 and messages in the
            current code page language displayed correctly).
        (+) Installer improved to re-select previous user-settings folder for
            upgrade installations from beta 2 or above.
        (*) Help-file updated to include new features and re-organized options screens.
        

4.0 (beta 5)
        (-) Running a second instance should bring the first instance to the front
            unless /MULTIPLE is specified. Behavior fixed to match PopTray 3.2.
        (-) Unexpected subject character page encodings should no longer cause
            error: '' is not a valid integer value 
        (+) Added a new advanced option to prefer balloon popups instead of modal
            dialogs (for error messages, when not minimized to tray)

4.0 (beta 4)
        (-) Fixed sounds not playing on Windows Vista since beta 2.

4.0 (beta 3)
        (-) Check for new version of PopTrayU re-enabled
        (-) Installer correctly creates directory for PopTray.ini
        (+) Visual Appearance dialog in options allows users to customize the font
            and colors used by the main window listbox showing new mail. saved to
            PopTray.ini and restored on startup. Custom skin template has been

        (-) Fixed broken link to help file on accounts tab
        (-) Fixed cancel button positioning on accounts tab

            Applies to: Vista or newer with system Accessibility Options enabled.
        (*) Notification sounds play at system notification sound volume 
            instead of shoing a separate volume control for PopTrayU in Vista+
        (-) Fixed installer to remove PopTray.ini and PopTray.customize on uninstall
        (+) New registry setting to select where PopTray.ini should be stored to 
            support Vista+ UAC permissions. Set by installer. Command line options
            can be used to override this setting.

	(+) Added HTML tab to preview window
        (*) Changed title format for preview window: now title is just the email's subject
        (*) Display more descriptive results than the socket error number when testing 
            an account with invalid server selected
	(+) Text boxes on "Defaults" options screen resize if window is resized
        (-) Options screens now correctly redraws missing labels/buttons on create and resize 
        (-) UTF-8 encoded email subjects and headers are now decoded and not shown as gibberish
        (-) Replaced message list on main window with Unicode-enabled version
            Fix applies to: rendering of UTF-8 encoded subjects only at this time, characters
            outside current code-page that are not encoded with UTF-8 still display incorrectly.
