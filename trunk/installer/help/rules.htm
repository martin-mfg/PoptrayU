			Just below the main buttons and to the left, is the list of all the rules

			details area. Selecting a rule will list its details with all of its
			various options, criteria and actions you want for the rule.<br><br>
			Just to the right of the rules list is where you will be adding or editing
			the rule details. The following can be set:<br><br>
