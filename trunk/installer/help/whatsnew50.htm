		<td class="info"><b>What's New in PopTrayU 5.0</b><br>
		New features and enhancements changed from PopTray 4.0.x <br>
		<br>
		Some of the most significant changes are:
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Entire UI can be Skinned with Themes</strong><br>
	The colors and look of buttons, scrollbars, and other visual components can be changed by applying a Delphi VCL theme. A few are included and many more can be downloaded online. <br>
           	  </li>
				<li><strong>Updated Images with Smooth Blending</strong><br>
	In many places PopTrayU now uses alpha-transparent PNG images, that blend in with the background smoothly, regardless of what background color is selected. The images for many of the options categories and many of the main toolbar buttons have been updated to be more clear and intuitive. <br>
           	  </li>
				<li><strong>Stability Improvements</strong><br>
	Upgrading both the Delphi Compiler and Indy Networking Components to a current version means no more labels that randomly disappear, and less crashes caused by Windows version compatibility issues. And in case that wasn't enough, a crash reporting tool is now included, which will make it easier to eliminate causes of unexpected crashes in future versions. <br>
           	  </li>
			  <li><strong>Better Multi-Language Support </strong><br>
	All language files are now UTF-8, so you can use any language you like, regardless of the code-page/locale of your computer. Many of the included translation files (including the blank templates) have been updated to be significantly more complete. Improvements have been made for display of right-to-left languages.</li>
	      </ul>
