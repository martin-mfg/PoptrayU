		<td class="info"><b>What's New in PopTrayU 4.1</b><br>
		New features and enhancements changed from PopTrayU 4.0.x <br>
		<br>
		Some of the most significant changes are:
			<ul>
				<li><b>New Account Configuration Options (eg: SASL) <br>
                	</b> Take advantage of the latest in networking security. By simply adding OpenSSL dll's to your PopTrayU directory, SSL support becomes enabled without any protocol plugins. Changes to the account configuration page, allows for easy toggling between SSL and insecure, and additional options for SSL can be automatically configured, or manually set. New options include  being able to choose your authentication mechanism (including the newly supported SASL authentication for POP3), STARTTLS mode, APOP, and  which version of SSL or TLS to use is configurable. APOP does not require OpenSSL libraries. <br>
           	  </li>
			  <li><strong>No more plugin needed for IMAP </strong><br>
	IMAP and POP3 support are now both in the core executable, meaning less plugins to install, and speed improvements for IMAP. Internal IMAP support includes most of the same security options as are offered for POP. </li>
		  </ul>
