					<td class="light">Change the font for most items displayed on PopTrayU's UI. The default font is either 8 pt MS Sans Serif (XP and before) or 9 pt Segoe UI (Vista and later). </td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="light" align="middle">Vertical Tabs </td>
					<td class="light">Changes the font used for the vertical tabs on the side of the main window (mail, accounts, options, etc). Because many fonts do not look good displayed vertically, you can customize the font for these tabs seperately than other UI elements. Default: MS Sans Serif 8pt.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="light" align="middle">Message List </td>
					<td class="light">Change the font as well as foreground (pencil icon) and background colors (paint can) for the list of new email messages in the main window. Many of the colors available are system UI colors, for coordination with the active Windows color scheme. The x button clears customizations to the font and colors for this item. </td>

				<tr>
				  <td class="light" align="middle">Theme</td>
				  <td class="light">The entire look of PopTrayU can be changed by choosing a different theme. The &quot;...&quot; button next to the theme dropdown can be used to load a theme from a file. Any Delphi Visual Style theme (*.vsf) may be used, including ones from third party sources. </td>

				<tr>
				  <td class="light" align="middle">Toolbar Color Scheme </td>
				  <td class="light">If you are using a (third party) dark windows theme, you should enable the &quot;twilight&quot; scheme. This scheme changes the highlight color for toolbar buttons, and uses an alternate version of some images that will look better on a dark background (for example, images may use white instead of black as a foreground color). If you are using the standard Aero theme or another light colored windows theme, the &quot;Normal&quot; color scheme should be selected.</td>
