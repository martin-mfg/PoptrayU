Updating PopTrayU Version Number
--------------------------------
1. uMain.PAS has variables called MajorVersion, MinorVersion, ReleaseVersion, etc. 
   This will change what's shown in the UI.
   
2. Project -> "Options..." -> "Version Info" also has version information. This 
   should be updated as well, so the Windows can read the version information
   from the binary.



Testing Arbitrary Emails
------------------------
   The following program is recommended for testing arbitrary emails.
   It acts as a local POP server on your machine getting the emails
   from plain-text files on your local machine.

   Included with the download is a PDF with installation instructions.
   The BAT file needs to be modified with correct directory options.

   Run mail.bat to make the server active.
   In PopTrayU, use: 
   server=localhost
   login=test@example.com
   password=test

   Add new raw emails to the users\test@example.com folder with a .LOC extension.
