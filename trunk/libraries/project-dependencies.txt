PROJECT DEPENDENCIES

This document describes the setup needed to build and release 
PopTrayU from source code. Where listed, version numbers are what is 
currently used to develop PopTrayU, however in some cases you may
wish to use the latest version available if it does not cause any
incompatibilities.

********************************************************************
DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT

To Build PopTrayU you will need Delphi 7, either Professional or 
Enterprise edition. It will not compile with the Personal edition.

To port to any version of Delphi newer than 2005 may require 
significant changes. It may be able to compile with Delphi 2005, 
however this has not been tested recently.

********************************************************************
SOURCE CODE DEPENDENCIES

To compile the source code, you will need the following additional
open source/free libraries linked into your Delphi environment. 
They may be obtained online or from the libraries area of the 
source tree.
